### Abstract

This thesis investigates a Curry-Howard correspondence between linear logic and a
type system for a typed synchronous $$\pi$$-calculus. We give a specification for a process
calculus and demonstrate how to reason about its concurrent programs. We
also provide an introduction to intuitionistic linear logic, a logic of resources, providing
explanations and examples of its connectives. The session-typed process terms
and logical rules will be in one-to-one correspondence. This correspondence provides
information about programs written in our concurrent programming language.
